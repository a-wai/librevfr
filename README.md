LibreVFR is an application designed for the Librem 5 (which I don't have yet).

The goal of this app is to provide helpful tools for VFR pilots:
  - VAC charts
  - Automated checklists
  - Interactive navigation log
  - Weather information

Please note that LibreVFR's development is in its early stages, and therefore
the app won't be really useful before quite some time.

Always carry a paper copy of the relevant documentation when flying!

To compile LibreVFR, you will need the development packages for the
following libraries:
  - GTK+ 3
  - libhandy
  - libcurl
  - json-glib

LibreVFR is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 3.
